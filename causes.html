        <h2>Industrial Waste</h2>
        <p>Industrial waste is a major cause of soil pollution. Many industries release harmful chemicals and toxins into the environment, which can seep into the soil and contaminate it. Some of the most common industrial pollutants include heavy metals, solvents, and pesticides.</p>

        <h2>Agricultural Practices</h2>
        <p>Agricultural practices are another major cause of soil pollution. The use of pesticides and fertilizers can contaminate the soil, as can the disposal of animal waste. Overuse of these chemicals can also lead to soil degradation and erosion, which can further harm the environment.</p>

        <h2>Improper Waste Disposal</h2>
        <p>Improper waste disposal is a significant contributor to soil pollution. When waste is not properly disposed of, it can end up in landfills or be dumped illegally, leading to contamination of the soil. This can include hazardous waste, such as batteries, electronics, and other chemicals.</p>
