				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Soil pollution is the presence of toxic chemicals (pollutants or contaminants) in soil that may have adverse effects on plants, animals, and humans. Soil pollution can occur naturally or as a result of human activities such as industrialization, mining, agriculture, and waste disposal.</p>

				<h2>Effects of Soil Pollution</h2>
				<p>Soil pollution can have a variety of negative effects on the environment and human health, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Contamination of groundwater and surface water</li>
					<li>Reduced soil fertility and crop yields</li>
					<li>Damage to wildlife and ecosystems</li>
					<li>Increase in air pollution</li>
					<li>Human health problems such as cancer, birth defects, and respiratory diseases</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Preventing Soil Pollution</h2>
				<p>Preventing soil pollution requires a combination of government policies, industry regulations, and individual actions. Some ways to prevent soil pollution include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Proper disposal of hazardous waste</li>
					<li>Reducing the use of pesticides and fertilizers</li>
					<li>Using sustainable farming practices</li>
					<li>Encouraging the development of clean technologies</li>
				</ul>

              <h2>Industrial Waste</h2>
              <p>Industrial waste is a major cause of soil pollution. Many industries release harmful chemicals and toxins into the environment, which can seep into the soil and contaminate it. Some of the most common industrial pollutants include heavy metals, solvents, and pesticides.</p>

            <section id="agricultural-practices">
              <h2>Agricultural Practices</h2>
              <p>Agricultural practices are another major cause of soil pollution. The use of pesticides and fertilizers can contaminate the soil, as can the disposal of animal waste. Overuse of these chemicals can also lead to soil degradation and erosion, which can further harm the environment.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="improper-waste-disposal">
              <h2>Improper Waste Disposal</h2>
              <p>Improper waste disposal is a significant contributor to soil pollution. When waste is not properly disposed of, it can end up in landfills or be dumped illegally, leading to contamination of the soil. This can include hazardous waste, such as batteries, electronics, and other chemicals.</p>
